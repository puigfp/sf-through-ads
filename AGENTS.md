# Plan mode

- when I ask you to plan, you should iterate on a plan written in markdown format and stored in `plans/YYYYMMDDHHMM-good-name-for-the-plan.md`, with time in 24h format, the plans will be committed to git
- ask me all the clarification questions needed so that another agent would be able to execute that plan without human feedback

# Updating AGENTS.md

- feel free to update this file with any additional information an agent should know about
